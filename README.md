Scripts
=======

This repository contains various small scripts that I have written to automate
my day-to-day activities. Some of these were written as part of some other
project but can be easily re-used with minor modifications and hence have been
added here.

I am willing to make exceptions to the licensing rule on a case-by-case basis.
